Features
SignUp and Login
The app allows users to create an account (SignUp) or log in if they already have one. The user authentication system is implemented using Firebase Authentication for simplicity.

ListView with YouTube's Top Videos
Once logged in, users can access a ListView displaying YouTube's top videos. The video data is fetched from the YouTube API and displayed in a scrollable list. Each list item contains the video's title, thumbnail, and other relevant information.

YouTube Video Player
Users can tap on a video from the ListView to open a YouTube video player, where they can watch the selected video. The video player uses the YouTube iFrame Player API for seamless playback.
